# Trees

Trees are non-linear data structures often used for keep data organized.
We typically use trees when the data that we are working with can be 
sorted / ordered.

#### Binary Tree

A Binary Tree is a data structure that keeps data in the form of a tree.
Data is stored in what's called a node, and for each node, there may exist
at most two children nodes - hence the name, Binary Tree.
