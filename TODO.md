# Things to Implement
List of things to implement, so that I don't forget

## Build
- Find some way to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` as well as 
install the python package `python-tk` if the development system is
linux based. Otherwise, `matplotlib` will fail
- Implement deploy script to upload the `java_data_structures.jar`
to a remote server or artifactory

## General
- Make `DataStructure` objects `extend Clonable` (if not too expensive of a change)

## Trees
- Finish analytics testing `BinarySearchTree`
- Put time-complexity comments in `BinarySearchTree` (for main operations)

## Vectors

## Testing
